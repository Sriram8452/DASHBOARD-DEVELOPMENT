### DESCRIPTION:

The project "Dashboard for Heart Disease Data" is a web-based interactive visualization tool developed using Dash and Plotly to analyze heart disease data. The core objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly dashboard that enables users to explore heart disease-related trends and distributions through interactive visualizations. The problem being addressed is the difficulty in understanding large datasets related to heart disease and extracting insights without technical expertise. By leveraging data visualization, this dashboard simplifies data interpretation, making it accessible for researchers, medical professionals, and data enthusiasts. The architecture of the project revolves around Dash, a Python web framework for data visualization, and Plotly, a library for generating dynamic plots. The dataset used is heart.csv, which contains medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, along with a target column indicating the presence or absence of heart disease. The working mechanism of the dashboard consists of multiple interactive components: a histogram to display feature distributions, a pie chart that represents the proportion of heart disease cases, and a scatter plot that allows users to explore relationships between different attributes. These visual elements are dynamically updated based on user input. The running instructions for this project involve setting up a Python environment, installing necessary dependencies (dash, plotly, pandas), and executing the Dash application to render the web-based interface. Users can interact with dropdown menus to select features for analysis, and the graphs update automatically based on their choices. The dashboard includes callbacks, a key feature of Dash, that links user input to real-time updates in visualizations. The histogram updates when a user selects a different feature, allowing for quick exploration of data distributions. The scatter plot enables correlation analysis between any two numerical features, while the pie chart provides an overview of heart disease occurrences. This project enhances data-driven decision-making by presenting a structured way to explore health-related patterns visually. It serves as a powerful analytical tool, especially for those who may not have a deep background in machine learning but need insights into heart disease trends. Future improvements may include additional interactive elements, deeper statistical analysis, or integration with real-time medical data sources to provide continuous monitoring capabilities. By simplifying the process of analyzing heart disease datasets, this dashboard contributes to early detection strategies, helping medical professionals and researchers make informed decisions quickly. ​​
